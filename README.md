# Leadership Principles:
 1. Give me an example of a time when you did not meet a clientâ€™s expectation. What happened, and how did (When You met hard customer)
    * Where : When I was working for a company x(Verizon), Mostly doing POC's.
    * S : I got a situation to demonstrate my Logstash Kubernets Pipeline Implementation to Customer
    * T : I was explaining the Overall Architecture and Pipeline and reusability of my Pipeline, Unexpectedly customer was asking more into the performance, scalability and reliability of the product
        I was not able to answer all the questions. But, I listen to them very carefully and taken down all the notes and reschedule the discussion.
    * A : I did work on all the tasks (Like collecting metrics, Test the Scalability.. etc.), which I have noted in my previous meeting and created document in Google Docs.
    *  R : In My Next meeting, I was able to satisfy the customer. They started the POC implementation of their Project
