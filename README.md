# Leadership Principles:
 1. Give me an example of a time when you did not meet a clientâ€™s expectation. What happened, and how did (When You met hard customer)
    * Where : When I was working for a company x(Verizon), Mostly doing POC's.
    * S : I got a situation to demonstrate my Logstash Kubernets Pipeline Implementation to Customer
    * T : I was explaining the Overall Architecture and Pipeline and reusability of my Pipeline, Unexpectedly customer was asking more into the performance, scalability and   reliability of the product
        I was not able to answer all the questions. But, I listen to them very carefully and taken down all the notes and reschedule the discussion.
    * A : I did work on all the tasks (Like collecting metrics, Test the Scalability.. etc.), which I have noted in my previous meeting and created document in Google Docs.
    *  R : In My Next meeting, I was able to satisfy the customer. They started the POC implementation of their Project
    
 2. Tell me about a time when you took on something significant outside your area of responsibility. Why was it important? What was the outcome?
    * Where : When I was working for CapitalOne
    * S : I got a situation to Interview customer
    * T : I never met customer to interview in my carrier, it was new iniative by comapany, From my team some should go for the interview
        I was not able to answer all the questions. But, I listen to them very carefully and taken down all the notes and reschedule the discussion.
    * A : I decided to take for my team. I was asked to attend the pre customer interview training(I learned many things like how to meet approch customer..etc)
    * R : I was able to meet customer multiple times and good review from customer.(We implemented the new web site what customer want instead how it should be)
    * **Why was it important**: We want to understand the customer as commpany
